    <h1 class="text-center">About page!</h1>

    <br>

    <h6 class = "paragraph">Purpose - To inform other of my strengths, passions, and needs and to possibly connect with other high school students 

      <br>
      Audience - Other high schoolers and specifically those in the Computer Science Academy, I hope they are able to gain insights and find similarities in my interests.
      <br>
      Justification - Since this is not a common/interesting topic, I should make my website relatively short. Since this information is not basic knowledge, I should include information on a table before the quiz. Since the objective of my website is to inform others of my strengths, passions, and needs, I should ensure the information is clear and understandable.</h6>

    <h6 class="paragraph">About Me - I am currently a senior in the Computer Science Academy at Oakland Technical High School and I enjoy trying new things! I got into coding through the courses and it is something I enjoy! In my free time, I enjoy walking my dogs and baking bread!  </h6>
